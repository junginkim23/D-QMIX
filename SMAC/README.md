# Installation 

### SMAC 
Run the script: 

    bash install_sc2.sh

When you run the above script, a folder named 3rdparty will be created, containing a StarCraftII directory. Inside StarCraftII, you will find the following folders and files: Maps, Replays, SC2Data, Versions, Libs, Interfaces, Battle.net, and .build.info.

Move the entire StarCraftII directory (including all these contents) to /root using the command below:

    cp -r /StarCraftII /root
